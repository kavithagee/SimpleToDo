# SimpleToDo Android App for CodePath

This app allows you to add new items, delete and edit existing items.

SimpleToDo app usage
* add items 
* delete by longClicking an item
* edit an item in a popup dialog by clicking an item 


I will be making future changes to the UI, adding features to the app and will try SQLlite for storage.
